I am a passionate developer specializing in game development and desktop application creation. My primary programming language for application development is C++, and I am also proficient in C#. I have experience working with the Qt framework for building cross-platform applications and have worked with MySQL for database management.

In the realm of game development, I have hands-on experience with Unreal Engine 5, as well as creating native C++ game engines. I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills, and I am a dedicated Linux enthusiast who enjoys leveraging open-source tools in my projects. 

Skills: C++ / C# / Qt / MySQL / Unreal Engine
